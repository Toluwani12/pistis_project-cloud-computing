# AWS Critical Thinking (Pratical Scenario)

Scenario 1:
As a senior DevOps engineer, you are tasked with designing a solution to ensure users in two different geographical locations, India and London, have a good browsing experience with minimal latency. Create an infrastructure solution that optimizes performance and minimizes latency for users in both regions. Consider factors such as content delivery networks (CDNs), edge caching, global load balancing, and region-specific deployment strategies to achieve this goal effectively. After designing the solutions (use draw.io), implement them and create the infrastructure in your AWS console.
